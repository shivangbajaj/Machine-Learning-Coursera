# Coursera Machine Learning (offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University)

Programming assignments from all weeks in the Coursera [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home) offered by `DeepLearning.AI` and `Stanford University`. This course is converted into a specialization and divided into 3 courses which fall under [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) from June 2022.

**Instructors**: `Andrew Ng`.

## Info

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:

- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
- Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that we'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this course. The code base and diagrams are taken from the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-course/home) course, unless specified otherwise.

## Disclaimer

I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully).
